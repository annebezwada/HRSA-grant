# HRSA-grant

During my Winter break, I decided to brush on my Tableau skills. To start, I thought it would be fun to create a dashboard that shows how much funding is given from the US government for various grants in the United States. I took data from data.hrsa.gov and built a dashboard using various graphs. Since it has been a minute from my last visualization, I thought it would be a good idea to first build the visualizations based on the published one from HRSA to make sure I am getting the right numbers. It looks like my memory didn't fail me! :)
